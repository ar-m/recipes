Ingredients:
 - 1 cup of ground semolina
 - 3 tablespoons of unsalted butter
 - tablespoons of natural set honey

Directions:
 1. In a saucepan heat the semolina over a medium-high heat. Keep shaking the pan until the semolina is evenly toasted & a rich golden brown colour. Pour into a bowl & set aside.
 2. Melt the butter in the empty pan you used to toast the semolina. Remove from the heat & stir in the honey.
 3. Pour the semolina back into the pan & mix well to combine it with the butter & honey. If you notice the semolina mixture is too runny or has a little extra butter on top, just add a little extra semolina to the pan. If the semolina mixture is a little too stiff to pour, add 1 teaspoon extra of both the butter & the honey & mix well.
 4. Pour the semolina mixture out onto a small dinner plate or side plate & decorate with the cinnamon, silver balls & any additional items you like. To make a pretty pattern with the cinnamon, use the rim of a small tea glass or shaped cookie cookers dipped in the ground cinnamon.
